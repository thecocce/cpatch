#Resolved the structure of Windows icon

= Introduction =

it's easy to add icons from exe/dll resource to another exe/dll, but hard to add from raw icon files, I've found the way to do it


= Details =

there're 2 structures for Icon: normal icon data, and group icon package, both Windows icon raw file and resource support it.

here's definitions in Object Pascal:
// raw icon data
  ICONDIRENTRY = packed record
    bWidth: BYTE;
    bHeight: BYTE;
    bColorCount: BYTE;
    bReserved: BYTE;
    wPlanes: WORD;
    wBitCount: WORD;
    dwBytesInRes: DWORD;
    dwImageOffset: DWORD;
  end;

// raw group icon package
  ICONDIR = packed record
    idReserved: WORD;
    idType: WORD;
    idCount: WORD;
  end;

// icon data for UpdateResource
  GRPICONDIRENTRY = packed record
    bWidth: BYTE;
    bHeight: BYTE;
    bColorCount: BYTE;
    bReserved: BYTE;
    wPlanes: WORD;
    wBitCount: WORD;
    dwBytesInRes: DWORD;
    nID: WORD;
  end;

// group icon for UpdateResource
  GRPICONDIR = packed record
    idReserved: WORD;
    idType: WORD;
    idCount: WORD;
    idEntries: GRPICONDIRENTRY;
  end;
